# House-price-prediction-system-advanced-techniques
The reporistory consists of advanced regression and boosting techniques to predict house prices. The data is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). The jupyter notebook consists 5 models, namely :
1. LinearRegression
2. LassoRegression
3. RidgeRegression
4. ElasticNet
5. XGBOOSTRegression

All these models have different accuracies and among them, XGB and ridge comes out to be the better model than others.
Models are only tested on validation set and i would like you to try it on test_data.csv, which is present in the the repository.
